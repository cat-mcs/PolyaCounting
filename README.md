# PolyaCounting
- Counting r-colourings of n-necklaces under cyclic rotation.
- Counting r-colourings of pocket cubes under cube actions.

### Instructions:
The number of beads on the necklace and the number of bead colours can be edited at the top of the NecklaceCount script. 

To generate the gap txt file, one needs to install GAP (https://www.gap-system.org/Download/) on their local device and use the commands listed in GAP_CubePermutations file to generate the cycle decompositions for elements of the cube permutation group.

Once this text file has been generated, the PocketCubeCount script can be used. The number of sticker colours can be edited at the top of the script (colours list).
